# My Portfolio

## THE Website that takes a look at my projects, education and certifications.
#### It builds an overall profile that explains my interests in Data Science and Web Development, as well as showcasing projects in both domains. 

### The Website contains the following information - 
* #### Who I am - As well as being a 21 year old Indian pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering, this website defines a lot more about my personal interests, career vision and overall enthusiasm towards the field.
* #### My educational background - The website takes its viewer through the timeline of my education, highlighting key information that cements my logical and aesthetic prowess. This includes a majority of my schooling within the STEM domain, and my hobbies and interests within the world of art - ranging from painting to writing. 
* #### My projects - Ah yes, this is where the bulk of deductions will start to form. This is the main reason for the garnered interest. The website takes an exhaustive look into every main project I have done within Data Science and Web Development, and provides links to directly view the projects (in the case of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/amaanvora), or [repositories](https://github.com/deadven7) containing source codes to my indepedent projects)
* #### [Almaeriff](https://almaeriff.wordpress.com) - This is my blog. Being an avid fan of writing and everything "movies and TV", I've combined my love for both and created this blog that picks apart and analyses classic and current movies and TV shows that peak my interest.

* #### HTML/CSS
